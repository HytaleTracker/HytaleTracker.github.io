Tomorrow, on Jan 13th at release time!\r\n- Where is it available? http://hytale.com/translations - the project is private for now.\r\n- How does it work? Once the project is public, you'll be able to join as a translator for one of the following languages and start submitting translations: French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, and Spanish. Then, translations will be approved by our proofreaders, and once approved, they will make their way into the game with the next update (this will be an ongoing process).\r\n\r\nWe're starting with only five languages to ensure we have dialed down the localization workflow (they were chosen by using Steam data and picking the languages with the most users).\r\n\r\nIn the following weeks, if everything goes right, we'll open the following languages: Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal), Turkish, and Ukrainian. For every language, we'll make only the client translation keys available.\r\n\r\nOnce we reach 90% of translations approved in a language, we will make every other key available for it.\r\n\r\nWe do so because the client contains the major translation keys that players will encounter initially (like for menu navigation, settings, etc...).\r\n\r\nOther languages (like Japanese and Korean) will be available for translation at a later date because we cannot support them technically in the client right now.\r\n\r\nOnce we move over to using Noesis and do some client modifications, we'll be able to support them.\r\n\r\nThank you all in advance for helping us make Hytale available in your language!'",
