Mewen also mentioned assessing text resizing options.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nDiscussing the game's tech, Slikey revealed that Hytale plans to have a compatibility layer in the future, to give players the change to update their mods and servers. Slikey later confirmed that Hytale does currently have an error similar to Minecraft's bug that leads to the 'farlands' phenomenon. Slikey also discussed merging all of the game's branches into a single branch in a <b><i>Singularity Event</i></b>. Simon also revealed that Hytale currently has no plans for custom shaders, but the team will explore options later on.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nMoving to gameplay discussions, Simon revealed that the <i>new</i> engine's lighting system can be replicated in the legacy engine, and the plan is to do so after optimizations are finished. Simon also revealed that Hytale's combat was designed with PVP in mind, but the current goal isn't to balance it for PVP or minigames. Simon also revealed that gliders have been added to Hytale, and that rat's can still be lured by dropped cheese.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nHytale officially shared a screenshot of a <u>Zone 3 Ritual</u>.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'></p>",

Simon also confirmed that the Early Access release date would be announced <i>by end of next week.</i> </p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nMoving on to gameplay discussions, Simon confirmed that Hytale will not have grid crafting, and will instead have a more innovative and intuitive crafting system that allows players to upgrade work stations. When asked about building, Simon announced that work on block rotations and other cool features was finished, with connections and smart block placements being polished. Simon also mentioned that plans exist for automations and fun gadgets, but aren't being worked on at the moment. Simon also teased gliders and hookshots as future features for Hytale, also revealing the discovery of a Faun model in the game's files. Finally, Simon shared the first ever picture of Slothians in-game. </p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nLater, Slikey explains that singleplayer mode creates a local server, allowing for 'server side' mods to work on singleplayer. Alleviating concerns, Slikey confirmed that despite this, singleplayer <b>can</b> be played without an internet connection. Finally, Slikey explained that it's likely too early for Hytale to be able to support a Create-like mod, though some parts should still be possible.</p>",

        "mainText": "<p class='mainTextParagraph'>On November 17th, 2025, Reddoons published an Exclusive Interview with Simon. In the interview, Simon stated that Exploration Mode was a temporary replacement for Adventure Mode, as the vision for the mode is far from what they can offer at the moment. Exploration Mode will server as the foundation for the game, eventually having a living world and other features that build and become Adventure Mode, such as dungeons, epic boss fights, and more. Exploration Mode will let players fight, loot, farm, explore, build, and play with friends - serving as more of a prologue to what Hytale will be. In the short to medium term, Simon wants to focus on fast wins, not spending months on a single update and instead bombarding players with constant updates before eventually moving to bigger updates when the game is in a solid state. Simon teases introducing features that are typical in RPGs or even ARPGs, and says the portals system in Hytale's End Game might be simple at launch, but is a feature that (in the long term vision) allows them to truly expand their creativity. Simon says Hytale is made different by its movements, combat, vibe, and controls, with the world gen v2 and ability to mod the game being very exciting to him. Crucially, Simon says he wants Hytale to not be a survival game, but an adventure game that is easy to learn and hard to master.</p>",

        "mainText": "<p class='mainTextParagraph'>On November 17th, 2025, AntVenom published an Exclusive Interview with Simon. In the interview, Simon stated he believes his decision to sell Hytale was still the right decision, as it secured funding for the team, and put him in position to be able to purchase Hytale and attempt to save it. While the goal is to reach the vision of Hytale presented in the trailer, things will change due to the changes in circumstances/genre over the years. Simon repeatedly states that the community should keep expectations low, realize the game will launch with many bugs and missing features, but maintain confidence that the game will eventually be great. The trailer was 'ambitious, but achievable.' Simon says he wants players to feel at home - safe, comfortable, and excited - when they play Hytale for the first time. When asked about a 'credits roll' moment, Simon says he envisions credits never rolling, with the story continuing to be updated for years - no defined end point in development. When asked about a roadmap, Simon says the first goal is launch - then create a decent gameplay loop. Success for Hytale means releasing as soon as possible, and updating one feature at a time for a long time. Simon finishes the interview by thanking the believers.</p>",
