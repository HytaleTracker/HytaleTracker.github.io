For  example, Paragon and Fortnite do not predict damage. Most likely they  use ExecutionCalculations for their damage which cannot be predicted anyway.\"\r\n\r\nWe already have a range of analogue capabilities in our \"Interaction\" system which does partial prediction and state management. We have work to do there but talking about fundamental architecture constraints is just Dunning-Kruger.'",
