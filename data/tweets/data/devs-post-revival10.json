That being said, please be patient if you are having issues making an account or receiving a verification email. We are being throttled a bit due to the sheer amount of signups. Very surprising to see that many people are still interested in Hytale, inspiring journey ahead!\r\n\r\nThe actual username reservation won't start today. It will begin rolling out this week, and then on Saturday (Dec 13th) for pre-orders if you're not on the mailing list, allowing you to secure your username as well.\r\n\r\nWe have reserved many known creators' names in preparation to avoid impersonation, and we have a mechanism in place to prevent anyone from squatting your username if you are a known creator. More info will follow this week. \r\nSpeaking of which, the Support a Creator rev share program is ready and will be deployed in the coming days for application.\r\n\r\nI want everyone to please remember, once again, that this will be a true early access experience. We got the game 3 weeks ago, and we are using an old build from 4 years ago. We have big plans for the future, and we are more than honoured to see you all supporting us!'",
