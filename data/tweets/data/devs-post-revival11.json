I did a few tweets/posts about it in the past, but clearly, there were signs on the road in different directions in 2019, and we needed money to keep going. I cannot tell the whole story, as you might understand. I did what was best for the game back then; I left and walked away from much bigger financial exit options to make sure the team was taken care of.\r\n\r\nAlso, bought back at minimum value? HAHA, I wish. I hope the numbers will become public someday so you can see the truth. Did you see the post where they said they had multiple offers for Hytale? I had to fight for it, and I did. I gambled my entire future on it. Given the game's low price, I don't see any return on investment for a couple of years. I do not get a salary. I would have been better off to keep my retirement funds in the S&P500 at that point! \r\n\r\nI also have to sacrifice time with my family and kids to make this happen. For the past 3 months, I haven't taken a single day off. There are days when I see my kids for 10 minutes max.\r\n\r\nWhy do I even do this? I was already retired and living a good life, so why bother buying this game and trying to fix it? Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, instead of buying a yacht, I could buy a game that I'm passionate about? Also, why the fuck would I buy a yacht if I have motion sickness on boats? 😅'",

Increase user retention by creating a good, safe space. \n- Complete our adventure mode by introducing quests and other systems that make a great adventure, possibly voice actors, in-game cinematics and more!\n- The game is funded as a passion project, and I want to have proper parental controls so that when my kids are playing, I feel comfortable with it.\n- Add automation systems at some point and other systems that extend the game's appeal for players who love to tinker. \n- Add accessibility options (including controllers)\n- Level up the visuals across the whole game, lighting improvements and much more\n- Listen and interact with the community\n\nand much much more.'",
