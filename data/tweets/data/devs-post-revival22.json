Yet, they are still overjoyed to see me for the small moments we share, as I worry I could become a stranger to them.\r\n\r\nMy only hope is for my sons to be inspired the passion and wish for them to find the same joy in their lives. I will spend more time with them when the game is stabilized after launch, as I will feel relieved from the burden of this curse.\r\n\r\nNo sacrifices, no Hytale.'",
