In fact, the real name for Z4 was not this one internally before asking for feedback. I went with Devastated Lands.\r\n\r\nBorea was the one that got the most concern, both internally and externally, as it was clashing with our biome names and future world gen 2 plans.\r\n\r\nHere are some screenshots I sent to my team when that was happening.'",
