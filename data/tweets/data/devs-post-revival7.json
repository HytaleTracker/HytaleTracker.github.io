With that we have to make sure every single library / software dependency we use is also compiling.\n\nWe are finishing up ripping out the last library that currently prevents us from compiling for Mac & Linux (x64 / arm64). \n\nOnce that is done, we can compile for Mac & Linux. But only then we can actually see if it works correctly and what bugs there are. We need to fix anything coming up and it is not estimate-able right now.\n\nIf there are no roadblocks during that final testing stage, we may be able to launch with support. If not, we need more time to fix those bugs. \n\nWe simply can't predict what the outcome is but as soon as we know, we will let you know and we will keep you in the loop to make sure you are aware when we have more data.'",

The potential is beyond imagination.\n\nEveryone, even non-devs, will be able to edit World Gen v2. World Gen artists will be a thing. Blog post coming soon, it's a big one. Be prepared.
