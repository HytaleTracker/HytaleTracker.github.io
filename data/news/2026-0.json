        "mainText": "<p class='mainTextParagraph'>The Hytale Team started the day off strong, with DevSlashNull (Hytale's Technical Producer) announcing that Hytale will ship with macOS support on January 13th, and will support any M-Series Macs. Simon revealed that he previously tested the game on a M1 Mac Mini with 8GB of RAM, and got ~60 FPS @ 1080P with a view distance a bit over 200 blocks. Separately, Slikey confirmed that Hytale will not support Intel Macs, as it would require separate maintenance and support.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nAround 11 AM CST, Simon shared a video showcasing a server-side mod created by a team member in their spare time, featuring top-down wave shooter style gameplay, akin to Vampire Survivors. Slikey later stated that he has a long list of limitations that are critical before mods like 'Create' can be... created, and stated he'd try to post the list some time in the next week.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nSlikey revealed new server information in a series of short tweets, confirming Hytale supports IPv6, does not yet have SRV records, and stated that Hytale does not currently have support for peer-to-peer custom lobbies 'yet.'</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nPerhaps the most important news of the day came with Simon's announcement that Hytale's <b><i>World Gen V2</i></b> blog post would release tomorrow, January 5th, at 10 AM EST.</p>",

Simon revealed that the blog will focus mainly on the tech, tools, and prototype examples to showcase what it can do and how, and won't have major screenshots/clips of the world itself. Simon revealed that only a few biomes have been made, which he says are unfinished, though he says the new world gen is designed to enable much faster creation while giving greater control.</p>",

The developer also confirmed that enchantments/other improvement options for gear do not currently exist, and mentioned that a parry system and a stagger system will probably be added later on, and a grave system will likely be re-attempted in the future.</p>",
