There are way too many different configurations and we don't have a standardized test-scenario. Hytale is too custom and depends on way too many things. \nMinigame server may easily hit 200+ players with a static world and without NPCs. When you abuse an exploration mode server just right, you can tank it's performance on 8 players or have a playable experience with 50 people depending on what you exactly you do.\n\nThis whole server hardware conversation simply doesn't have a good answer. Instead of trying to get more and more data, I rather go back to improving server performance and focus on launch. It is not what the community of server hosters wants to hear but: You will have to try it out and see. I do not think I can give you reliable data.'\n\n(Important image attached)",

It is incomplete, and we are continuing to iterate on it.\n\nOne concrete example is client-local scripts and client-local asset packs. I did not properly account for the amount of client customization that is possible without client modification. Through our equivalent of data packs, we can actually do quite a lot here.\n\nYes, this approach appears limiting. Yes, Hytale is more limited than Unreal, Unity, or true Wild West modding.\n\nThose limits are not arbitrary. They exist because they allow modders - and us - to reach a massive audience, keep players safe, and build a UGC ecosystem that can scale. Our goal is to push UGC into a new golden age, with a model that simply hasn't existed before.\n\nOn features like shaders, LODs, cubic chunks, etc.: I love these topics. Trust me, we want to make Hytale the golden standard for block game technology. How that all looks years from now is unpredictable. We work on many things we don't talk about, and some of them may eventually materialize in one form or another.\n\nWe have very high aspirations for Hytale but for now: We will release ASAP. Take LODs and cubic chunks as an example. We are already working on chunks and voxel storage at a level more fundamental than cubic chunks. This is an order-of-operations problem. One step at a time and the next step is.\n\nSo I don't want you to fish for promises - because we wish our promises to remain special and reliable. Judge us by our actions, and hold us accountable for whether this direction is the right one.\nThe honest answer to most \"will you add X?\" questions is: we could. If you ask, \"Do you want this in Hytale?\"- the answer is more than likely yes.\nRight now, we have a list of high-priority, foundational problems that must be solved first. While doing that, we'll continue picking up smaller community improvements where it makes sense - often while we're already performing \"surgery\" on adjacent systems.\n\nFor modders specifically: please work with creators who can help surface concerns clearly and constructively - people like \n@Kaupenjoe\n or \n@Zeusley\n. Form a focused group, articulate real problems and real needs, and bring that feedback with a unified, constructive voice. That is how we make this better together.'",

    "mainText": "'We are delivering on our promise and releasing Hytale into Early Access on January 13, 2026, with all the consequences that come with that decision.\n\nIn just a few weeks, we merged roughly 300 branches, modernized a four-year-old code & asset base, scaled the team from 8 people to 50 core developers plus ~250 helping hands, tracked close to 1,000 bugs and fixed hundreds of them, added Mac and Linux support, and built an Exploration Mode that simply did not exist before.\n\nWhen we started the mission to save Hytale, we made a clear promise: Launch without any delays, at any cost.\n\nWe are keeping that promise, even though it is a herculean task. In an alternate timeline, the most intelligent production decision would be to delay launch by 3-4 months, complete the obvious work in front of us, and avoid the overhead and distractions of maintaining a live product. The game would objectively be better on day one. That is not what we are doing.\n\nMoving this fast also comes with very real downsides, and you have already seen them. We make visible progress every week, sometimes so much that key community members work overtime to keep up with the news - but you have also seen us drop the ball.\n\nSome concrete examples:\n\n1- Name reservations were intended to reward longtime fans. Still, we lacked sufficient time and information to verify the email list's integrity, and some longtime fans were missing from it.\n2- The username generator produced unintended results, and our name filters failed to catch some unacceptable cases.\n3- The payment system continues to report issues.\n4- Communication regarding avatar customization, Steam release, modding, and pricing was insufficiently detailed, leading to misinterpretation or confusion.\n5- Blog posts and technical write-ups have landed on an unpredictable schedule.\n6- Game server providers, server owners, creators, and business inquiries are not receiving responses as quickly as we would like or as they deserve.\n\nThis is the tradeoff we all have to accept: You can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. We wish we had more time to double-check every step and spend more time on communication, but that time comes at a steep opportunity cost. Extra polishing reduces the overall impression of Hytale on January 13. Our primary focus is the game.\n\nThe team is in a constant release cycle. Every week until launch is tightly scheduled, and we are doing this with a core team of around 50 people assembled in weeks, not a massive AAA organization. That means we are taking hundreds of calculated risks every day. Most pay off. A small fraction doesn’t - and when they don’t, the impact is very evident.\n\nIf I could ask for one thing from the community, it’s this: Please keep reminding each other what this pace implies - especially newer players who were not around for the #SaveHytale moment and may not know what the Early Access experience is meant to be for us. \nSome people will not be able to get their desired username. Some will run into payment issues. Some information will arrive later than it ideally should. This is not because we don’t know better; it’s because we are choosing to keep a promise.\n\nFor us, Early Access success looks like this: you start a world, and the first impression and immersion leave you thinking, “This is much better than they said.” After more time, you also start to see the rough edges - and still end your first day thinking, “This game has a lot of potential. I’ll come back and keep up with updates,” or get you inspired to get into making maps, content, mods or a minigame server.\n\nAs you will be playing through the first week of Hytale, we will already follow up with the first patch. We will release updates rapidly in the first few weeks, with pre-releases available more frequently. You start on the 4-year-old archeology project, but within months, you will find yourself in a flow of rapid development, previously unthinkable.\n\nWe appreciate that the community has high expectations for Hytale, but please remember that we are fulfilling a promise we made early on: to release as soon as possible. That is what the core community asked for. Our biggest fear right now is not criticism - it’s that the story of #SaveHytale gets forgotten during Early Access, and the team ends up wishing we had simply delayed those extra four months instead of keeping our word.'",

We need to complete a tuning/configuration pass, and we should be ready to launch with it. I tested today and spent a few hours just flying around and having fun finding happy little accidents.\n\nThis changes A LOT; every playthrough will be vastly different, so we want to make sure gameplay-wise it's still balanced and that we don't have issues where some zones near spawn are too small, etc. \n\nRight now, the tech can verify that Zone 1 is large enough to spawn the player, but we want to make sure Z2-3-4 are OK. Maybe it's fine if sometimes they are small, as the world is infinite, you could still travel to see bigger ones anyway.\n\nThat said, we need to lock in the zone names instead of using Zone 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThe names shouldn't change much from what the public knows, but maybe a tiny bit to clarify and avoid confusion with regions (biomes) names. Will confirm this week.'",

We believe that a 3 vCore + 8 GB server can sustain 6-8 players. A Ryzen 7950x with 12 GB RAM server, we were able to push 70 players but TPS degraded until the server crashed (~45 minutes). \nI think we will defintiely see 200 player minigames such as Mega Walls or Super Sky Wars. While vanilla SMP is going to require some beefy hardware to push 100 players in a single SMP.\nWe are continuing our effort to improve stability and further add performance optimizations to get those big anarchy servers.'",

For  example, Paragon and Fortnite do not predict damage. Most likely they  use ExecutionCalculations for their damage which cannot be predicted anyway.\"\r\n\r\nWe already have a range of analogue capabilities in our \"Interaction\" system which does partial prediction and state management. We have work to do there but talking about fundamental architecture constraints is just Dunning-Kruger.'",
