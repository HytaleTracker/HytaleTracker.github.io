        <h3>"Simon, what have you been doing for the past five years? Why buy back Hytale?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- When I sold Hytale in 2020, I believe it was the right decision for the team, and I still do. They needed funding
        and support to deliver the vision we built together. I was running out of money to keep funding development,
        and I didn't want to take money from players while big engine and vision changes were still on the table.
        After the trailer went mega viral in 2019, I received several offers, but I chose Riot because I trusted them to take
        care of the team and the project. I also didn't feel like I was the right person to lead that next phase. I chose to leave.
        Given the context, it was the right call. I can't share every detail, but as I've said before, I didn't feel I could
        deliver the changes we needed at the time. The sale gave me financial freedom. I focused on my health, started a family, and worked
        part time on the Hypixel Minecraft server, which improved revenute and stability for the team. A few years later,
        some former Hytale developers approached me to start a new studio. Building games together brought back that spark.
        That's what led me to buy back Hytale and finish what we started. I am way more happy today buying Hytale, than I was
        selling it and getting money. Over the last 5 years, I've realized my happiness comes from creating games. Hytale brings me the most joy.
        You can live edit, experiment, fail fast, build minigames, and push ideas with no limit. I'm grateful to have the chance to work on it again
        with such a great team.</blockquote>
        
        <h3>"When Hytale was first shown off in 2018, its reveal was quite ambitious. How has the core vision of the game changed since then, if at all?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- I stepped away from decision-making around mid-2019 and left the company in 2020, so I can't commend on anything that happened after that.
        Today, I have the chance to revisit the original vision shown in the trailer. I'm working towrad a clear milestone to reach that trailer vision as
        soon as possible. A few things will need to change because the industry has evolved, tools have advanced, and the reality of the genre
        has shifted. We'll explain those changes when they happen. One example is instead of relying on our old custom tools for models and animations,
        we're working with BlockBench. Going back to the original vision also means returning to a four year old build running on the same engine used for
        the trailer. That build was never meant to ship in a few weeks, so there's a lot of cleanup and problem solving ahead to get that working. I'd
        like the community to keep its expectations low for now. At the same time, I'll put in the work for the next few years to deliver a great game.
        And the players will be along for the ride very soon.</blockquote>

        <h3>"How long were you in development before the initial announcement of Hytale?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- I was involved from the very beginning. I funded the project myself for the first 3 years. We began exploring ideas in 2015, started real development
        in 2016, and became more active in 2017. I was closely involved in the early stages before the trailer and worked with the team on the trailer, which
        helped solidify the vision.</blockquote>

        <h3>"Do you have any regrets with the original trailer?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- No, I loved the original trailer, which clearly communicated the vision. It was ambitious, but achievable. It was the vision I wanted for Hytale and 
        still want today. Back then, we needed to show players and creators what we were aiming for and to confirm we were heading in the right direction.
        It helped us decide if growing the team made sense at that time. That trailer worked well. It helped secure incredible funding, which , unfortunately,
        led to my exit; however, it provided the team with the resources and experienced people they needed. Given my situation at the time, it was still
        the right call.</blockquote>

        <h3>"What experience do you most want players to have when they play Hytale for the first time?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- I want players to feel at home. Imagine coming back from school right as the holiday break starts. That feeling of being safe, comfortable, and excited
        to settle in. That's what I want Hytale to give you the first time you play it. I also want creative players to feel a spark of new ideas. I want them to 
        use our content, shape your own experiences, and feel excited to share what you make.</blockquote>

        <h3>"For those who have been waiting since 2018, what can players expect from the game?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- Let's set realistic expectations. Many features will be missing at launch. Minigames that were shown or talked about in the past won't be there on day
        one. There will be bugs and it will feel like real early access. We will need the community to help us move forward. Right now, the game is not good enough
        in my opinion, and I'm aware of that. Modding already has a lot to offer, but we want to add more tools and features for modders, server owners, and map makers.
        There is so much missing, but we need to get the game out, and we need to break the curse. We will work hard over the next months and years to reach our
        original vision. I have spent more than 15 years working in this game genre. I know the direction I want to take the game, and the team is aligned. We
        have years of development to catch up on compared to other similar games. If we can produce at a high rate, we will get where we want to be. Players will 
        get a game that is cared for by its owners. This is our legacy project and our long-term project.</blockquote>

        <h3>"What message do you want to give to fans who have been waiting for years and may feel skeptical?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- I can only earn their trust by making a good game. After all these years, words don't mean much. I'm here for the long run and they can join whenever they
        feel the game deserves their time, early or later.</blockquote>

        <h3>"You previously sold Hypixel Studios to Riot Games and they were, frankly, gracious enough to sell it back to you. If somebody else came up with an open wallet,
        would you even give them a look?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- This time around, no amount of money could make a difference in my life. Back then, it allowed me to become financially free and do great things, which
        allowed me to even repurchase Hytale. What I enjoy the most in life is workling with talented people, and this gives me exactly that. From engineering to art,
        it's great. Retirement was not great. Honestly, I only find joy in solving difficult problems and Hytale happens to be one difficult beast. I thrive
        on high stress environments and this is very exciting to me.</blockquote>

        <h3>"Do you envision a point in Hytale's Story Mode where the story will end and the credits will roll?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- I think the way I see Hytale is there will be no credits rolling. We'll keep releasing chapters to the story and adventure as years go by, a bit like how
        MMOs tell their stories.</blockquote>

        <h3>"Will there be a defined end point in Hytale's development?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- The game will continue to receive ongoing updates for many years to come. I don't see an end point. I have two kids, age two and three, and I want them to
        grow up playing Hytale through many future updates. The reality is that I'm taking time away from my family to save Hytale. Time away from my kids that I will 
        not get back, so the least I can do is try my best to make a great game so they can enjoy and be proud. I want to share great moments with my children in 
        Hytale and create core memories.</blockquote>

        <h3>"On the topic of actual development, what does your roadmap look like? Is there anything that players should be looking out for?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- The first task is to launch early access as soon as possible. We will need time to clean up, fix crashes, and make sure it's somewhat ok to be played.
        Secondly, we want to create a decent gameplay loop to keep players engaged for a bit while we are working on long-term goals. We are adding mechanics, such as
        Portals and Memories, which will be explained at a later date. Making a living world will be a top priority for us; it will require a significant amount of work
        to make the game feel like a living world. Some palyers will want to just take care of their farm, their home and socialize with their friends, we want to support that.
        The roadmap will be a bit all over the place initially as we adapt to the game. I also want to keep some surprises. However, let's aim towards the trailer vision
        first.</blockquote>

        <h3>"You're doing a Support-A-Creator system. Do you have any comments on what inspired that and where it might end up in the future?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- We have had great success with this approach in the past, having paid millions of dollars to content creators, which has enabled some of them to earn an 
        additional income on top of their YouTube channel and allowed some to make YouTube their first full-time career. It's a win-win situation all around, and 
        I want to give back to the people who have supported my journey all these years.</blockquote>

        <h3>"What does success look like for Hytale now, and how do you define it differently than before, if at all?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- Succes for Hytale is now simply to me. Release it as soon as possible and continue updating it for al ong time. One feature at a time. Eventually, it will
        "click" and be great. The truth is, the prime window for a massive, successful launch has passed. Our job now is to focus, work hard, and finish the game
        after the early access launch. Hytale would have had a much bigger impact if everything landed at once. But that level of pressure isn't realistic.
        Getting the game out and improving it step by step is what success looks like today.</blockquote>

        <h3>"For the people who have never heard of Hytale, and only know of you from the Minecraft server Hypixel, why should they buy your game?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- I see Hytale as the natural evolution of Hypixel minigames. Think of it like Hypixel 2. We could bring new ideas to life with features like</blockquote>
        proximity voice chat to create new social games, better combat mechanics, and experiences we could never dream of before. We also want to bring classics.
        This time, we're in complete control of our own destiny.

        <h3>"If you could say one thing directyl to the players who never stopped believing, what would that be?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- The community is the number one reason I went through with this. The support I've received kept me motivated through the whole process and pushed
        me to go all in. It was very difficult at times and the messages I was seeing on social media made a difference, you all saved HYTALE at the end of the day."</blockquote>
