Simon also noted that weapons don't currently use durability, though it can be enabled, and added that (by default) players will lose some materials and durability upon death.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nSimon noted that the armor broke during the video, and thus only offered 50% benefits.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nWhen asked about spears and other weapons, Simon confirmed many additional weapon types exist in the game, but only in creative mode as they require work/special abilities. The developer also confirmed that enchantments/other improvement options for gear do not currently exist, and mentioned that a parry system and a stagger system will probably be added later on, and a grave system will likely be re-attempted in the future.</p>",
