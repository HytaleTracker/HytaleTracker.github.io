I also don't really buy games outside of Steam, so I get the hate.\r\n\r\nHowever, the best-selling game of all time is not on Steam.'",

Already doing so.\n\nWe will be hiring writers and lore wizards after early access launch. Salvage as much as we can. \n\nWe have a “back to basics” lore template at the moment, using what was done many years ago, inspired from some concept shown.  Building a strong foundation.'",
