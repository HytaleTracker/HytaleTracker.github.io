Discussing the magic system, Simon says the books/staves in-game are currently boring like in the old clips, but the team has found interesting stuff that he'll share soon. On Bosses, Simon says there aren't any that he's happy with at the moment, though some are broken yet interesting. Simon confirms the plan is to have a living world, with predators chasing prey and more. Simon then shares the first screenshot from Hytale's Legacy Engine - a Zone 3 Shadow Knight - saying the mob doesn't yet spawn or have a purpose, but is available to be used by modders. Simon later shares the first look at Creation Tools in Hytale, teases the redesigned Kweebecs being in the game, yet separate from legacy Kweebecs. Finally, Simon confirmed everything is editable while the game/server is running.</p>",

        "mainText": "<p class='mainTextParagraph'>On November 17th, 2025, Reddoons published an Exclusive Interview with Simon. In the interview, Simon stated that Exploration Mode was a temporary replacement for Adventure Mode, as the vision for the mode is far from what they can offer at the moment. Exploration Mode will server as the foundation for the game, eventually having a living world and other features that build and become Adventure Mode, such as dungeons, epic boss fights, and more. Exploration Mode will let players fight, loot, farm, explore, build, and play with friends - serving as more of a prologue to what Hytale will be. In the short to medium term, Simon wants to focus on fast wins, not spending months on a single update and instead bombarding players with constant updates before eventually moving to bigger updates when the game is in a solid state. Simon teases introducing features that are typical in RPGs or even ARPGs, and says the portals system in Hytale's End Game might be simple at launch, but is a feature that (in the long term vision) allows them to truly expand their creativity. Simon says Hytale is made different by its movements, combat, vibe, and controls, with the world gen v2 and ability to mod the game being very exciting to him. Crucially, Simon says he wants Hytale to not be a survival game, but an adventure game that is easy to learn and hard to master.</p>",

In the interview, Simon stated he believes his decision to sell Hytale was still the right decision, as it secured funding for the team, and put him in position to be able to purchase Hytale and attempt to save it. While the goal is to reach the vision of Hytale presented in the trailer, things will change due to the changes in circumstances/genre over the years. Simon repeatedly states that the community should keep expectations low, realize the game will launch with many bugs and missing features, but maintain confidence that the game will eventually be great. The trailer was 'ambitious, but achievable.' Simon says he wants players to feel at home - safe, comfortable, and excited - when they play Hytale for the first time. When asked about a 'credits roll' moment, Simon says he envisions credits never rolling, with the story continuing to be updated for years - no defined end point in development. When asked about a roadmap, Simon says the first goal is launch - then create a decent gameplay loop. Success for Hytale means releasing as soon as possible, and updating one feature at a time for a long time. Simon finishes the interview by thanking the believers.</p>",
