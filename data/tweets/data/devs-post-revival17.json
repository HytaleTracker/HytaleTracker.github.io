For the first time, artists and game designers can take full ownership of world generation, with complete control over the final result. This is a fundamental shift away from a world shaped almost solely by programmers.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm pleased to announce that we're planning to expand the Hytale team with a new job role that, for the most part, has not existed in block-based games before: World Designer. Following the early access release, we plan to expand our team by hiring more than 15 World Designers. These roles will be filled primarily from the community, as artists and game designers learn and build using the same tools we use internally and choose to apply.\n\nHytale's vision is to feel carefully handcrafted while remaining infinitely procedural, with design always serving gameplay first!\n\nWe are intentionally expansive, just as we envisioned years ago. Beyond Orbis, we plan to explore alternate worlds, new dimensions, and entirely different spaces. These worlds give us room to introduce new blocks, items, prefabs, zones, regions, biomes, NPCs, quests, stories, and gameplay systems.'",
