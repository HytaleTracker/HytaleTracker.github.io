Riot Games will send that list.\n\nThe only information that I have is that there was a re-registration campaign during the time I was not there, between 2020 and 2025. This list is about 65% smaller than what it was in 2020 before I left Hytale.\n\nJust now, after reading your comments tonight, I'm learning that many of you didn't get the re-registration campaign email, so imagine my surprise and frustration, as I have put a lot of value in these emails.\n\nThe good news is, we want to make sure the process is as fair as possible for everyone and give people a shot at reserving the names they want. We will provide additional username tokens this week to people who sign up for Hytale accounts directly on the website.\n\nThese will come during the email campaign as it rolls out later this week.\n\nCheers!'",

That being said, please be patient if you are having issues making an account or receiving a verification email. We are being throttled a bit due to the sheer amount of signups. Very surprising to see that many people are still interested in Hytale, inspiring journey ahead!\r\n\r\nThe actual username reservation won't start today. It will begin rolling out this week, and then on Saturday (Dec 13th) for pre-orders if you're not on the mailing list, allowing you to secure your username as well.\r\n\r\nWe have reserved many known creators' names in preparation to avoid impersonation, and we have a mechanism in place to prevent anyone from squatting your username if you are a known creator. More info will follow this week. \r\nSpeaking of which, the Support a Creator rev share program is ready and will be deployed in the coming days for application.\r\n\r\nI want everyone to please remember, once again, that this will be a true early access experience. We got the game 3 weeks ago, and we are using an old build from 4 years ago. We have big plans for the future, and we are more than honoured to see you all supporting us!'",
