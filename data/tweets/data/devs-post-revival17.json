We only had time to make a few biomes, all of which are unfinished.\n\nThe good news is that it's designed to enable much faster content creation while giving us greater control. \n\nThere will be a lot of screenshots, clips and text. If you only look at the visuals, you will not understand the scope of why this is a big step. \n\nTo the untrained eye, it won't seem like a big deal.
