Increase user retention by creating a good, safe space. \r\n- Complete our adventure mode by introducing quests and other systems that make a great adventure, possibly voice actors, in-game cinematics and more!\r\n- The game is funded as a passion project, and I want to have proper parental controls so that when my kids are playing, I feel comfortable with it.\r\n- Add automation systems at some point and other systems that extend the game's appeal for players who love to tinker. \r\n- Add accessibility options (including controllers)\r\n- Level up the visuals across the whole game, lighting improvements and much more\r\n- Listen and interact with the community\r\n\r\nand much much more.'",
