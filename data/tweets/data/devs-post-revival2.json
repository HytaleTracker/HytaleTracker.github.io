We will not have things like Redstone for example. Magic will be part of Hytale in many aspects, very much so fantasy feeling.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is, our crafting is moreso like the games like Valheim / Terraria instead of grid crafting. So its very different and allows us to go in a different direction.\r\n\r\nI have great respect for the people at Mojang, they have created an amazing game and community, our games will be very different, Minecraft is still one of my favourite game of all time.'",
