Graphics: We currently have a renderer based on OpenGL 3.3 / 4.1. Mobile devices usually use Vulkan or OpenGL ES. We plan to support to Vulkan / Metal / DX12 for PC Platform reason (e.g. async buffer writes) anyway, so we want to wait for that.\r\n2. UI / UX: Playing a game on phones is vastly different to keyboard+mouse / gamepad. The screensize is much smaller, network connection is limitted, battery power is most limitted, touch controls, etc.\r\n3. Compliance / Store Integration: Any phone target also comes with drastic differences in our ability to service patches, feature rollouts, payment methods, etc. \r\n\r\nOverall this is something that is quite a bit more than just x86 vs arm. We are targetting arm64 anyway with our builds for native MacOS M1+ support, so FEX doesn't really solve anything for us.'",
