Responding to community questions and requests stemming from that post, Thomas confirmed that the team aims at being as inclusive as possible, and will keep adding more and more inclusive hairstyles from different cultures. Additionally, Thomas stated that longer hairstyles are desired, though tech issues prevent their addition, as well as mixed hair tints - though the team is exploring tech solutions to both down the line.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nSimon provided an update on PVP, stating that knockback had been 'fixed,' though wouldn't be properly balanced at launch. Additionally, he revealed the addition of an Health Bar toggle for servers. Furthermore, Simon revealed the addition of fruit trees to Hytale - though it is unclear what type of fruit trees now exist.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nResponding to questions regarding playing with friends, Simon stated that, while a Friends List won't be in the game at launch, a prototype is in the works and should be implemented in the first few months. At the moment, playing with friends is done via an invite code system.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nFinally, Simon shared that a few dev team members are already focused on post-launch patches and updates, adding that the team has a massive list of 'obvious' issues/updates that need to be done ASAP.</p>",

The blog included many videos and screenshots showcasing World Gen V2, showcasing and explaining various features.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nA major 'selling point' of World Gen V2 is the node editor system, which allows <b>anyone</b> to create and modify world-gen without knowing how to code. Additionally, any world-gen edits are live-reloaded in-game to reflect any changes made, allowing creators to control terrain shape, biome transitions, materials, props, and other world generation factors.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nThe Team also committed to publishing first-party tutorials, guides, and documentation, and (soon enough) hire over 15 World Designers, primarily from the community.  Simon estimates that starting salaries for World Designers would be around $80K~$100K USD a year.</p>",

Separately, Slikey confirmed that Hytale will not support Intel Macs, as it would require separate maintenance and support.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nAround 11 AM CST, Simon shared a video showcasing a server-side mod created by a team member in their spare time, featuring top-down wave shooter style gameplay, akin to Vampire Survivors. Slikey later stated that he has a long list of limitations that are critical before mods like 'Create' can be... created, and stated he'd try to post the list some time in the next week.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nSlikey revealed new server information in a series of short tweets, confirming Hytale supports IPv6, does not yet have SRV records, and stated that Hytale does not currently have support for peer-to-peer custom lobbies 'yet.'</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nPerhaps the most important news of the day came with Simon's announcement that Hytale's <b><i>World Gen V2</i></b> blog post would release tomorrow, January 5th, at 10 AM EST.</p>",
