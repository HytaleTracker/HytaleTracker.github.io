    "mainText": "'People ask me how I feel about getting Hytale back and getting closer to release. Honestly, the transparent answer is anger.\r\n\r\nThe game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features. That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used. \r\n\r\nWhen you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\nIt’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.\r\n\r\nIt should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.\r\n\r\nSo yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves.'",
