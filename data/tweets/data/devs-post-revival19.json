We already have the live mindset and our workflows have users in them. \r\n\r\nIt's far from relaxing but it's the way to actually make progress. This is easy for many small projects with few users but we are doing this at viral scale. You will have a front-row seat to transparent development that you will rarely see at such scale.'",
