Ktar also explained that the World Gen Editor has been expanded, which is why it's now named the 'asset node editor.'</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nWhen asked about the forms of progression in Hytale, Simon explained that players will upgrade crafting stations to unlock more crafting options and other bonuses, with Hytale being mostly designed around world/item-based progression for now. Simon later said he likes Path of Exile 2's gem system, and it's a system he might experiment with for Hytale.</p>",

Simon began with a detailed recap of the work that has been done so far - modernizing a four-year-old code & asset base, bug tracking and fixing, and creating Exploration Mode. Describing the work required to launch without any delays as a 'herculean task,' Simon reaffirmed the team's commitment to keeping that promise, rather than delay 3-4 months. Simon also recapped where the team has 'dropped the ball,' including name reservations, username generator producing 'unacceptable' results, and many other issues. Simon ended his statement by asking the community to inform the uninformed, and to remember the #SaveHytale movement.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nNot to be outdone, Slikey released his own statement on Hytale's modding strategy, describing it as 'incomplete' and '[flawed].' Slikey continued by acknowledging that Hytale's approach to modding might look arbitrary, and saying the team is working on the 'high-priority, foundational problems that must be solved first' before they can move to the features that they want Hytale to have. Slikey later added that Hytale's asset, plugin, and entity-component systems build the modularity backbone they want for servers.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nRegarding server performance, Slikey stated that Hytale is too custom and dependant on various variables to provide specific server specifications, and stated that he would rather go back to improving server performance and focus on launch, rather than trying to get players more data.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nFinally, Thomas Frick teased a future Art Blogpost <i>and</i> a World-Gen Blogpost.</p>",

Polina also confirmed that players can mix and match cosmetics, and the resolution for player cosmetics is 64x64. Simon later linked an old avatar customization blogpost, which he says looks correct from a glance.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of a <i>Create: Aeronautics</i> style mod in Hytale, Slikey explained that features that make that type of mod possible are on a 'future work' list, which currently has no timeline. Discussing server-side physics, Slikey says interpolation exists, but prediction is currently limited, and consistency can't be relied on, with more data being required to see where to invest effort.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nFinally, Oscar shared on Twitter than the Hytale OST can be reworked, chopped up, and remixed freely - <i>as long as AI is not used in the process.</i></p>",

        "mainText": "<p class='mainTextParagraph'>After a convoluted discussion on Twitter the previous day, Simon announced he had updated the answer to a Steam release question in the FAQ blog. The updated answer clarifies that the goal is to spend Early Access working with the existing community to improve the game, rather than reacting to a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game's direction. Simply put, the Hytale Team want the first steps of Hytale's journey to be influenced by informed players. The statement notes that Steam doesn't currently support some of Hytale's modding features.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nOn a brighter note, Simon announced that Hytale will be sharing screenshots of the cosmetic sets included in the Early Access editions (Standard, Supporter, and Founders Edition) on <b><u><i>December 6th, at 10AM EST</i></u></b>, with a short clip showcasing the capes in motion. Simon also confirmed that more cosmetics will be added to each edition over the duration of Early Access, and each tier gets the cosmetics from the tiers beneath it. Simon also confirmed that the capes will have animations.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nRegarding modding in Hytale, Slikey addressed the two approaches to mods - Mod Assets vs Mods for Players. While a mod asset 'marketplace' is not a planned 1st party feature for Hytale, 'Mods for Players' has five different options.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nThe first option is <b><u><i>free mods</i></u></b>, which Slikey notes generally have the highest acceptance and most vibrant ecosystems. Slikey notes that modders themselves free mods, but would also like a future where they can pay themselves and potentially expand to a team -- these mods are usually supported by platforms via ads or premium subscriptions.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nThe second option is <b><u><i>Donations</i></u></b> or a <b><u><i>Pay What You Want</i></u></b> approach. Slikey says this shows good revenue data for well done mods, isn't a walled garden, and has high acceptance - but there's no security in this approach.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nThe third option is <b><u><i>Freemium Mods</i></u></b>, where the base mod is free, but you can pay for certain benefits. An example would be Minecraft's <i>Optifine</i> mod.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nThe fourth option is <b><u><i>Paid Mods</i></u></b>, which is a safer income option for modders, but is more accessible to players and turns a mod browser into a marketplace. Slikey notes that players view this very negatively, with it also creating a piracy situation.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nThe fifth option is <b><u><i>Closed Mods</i></u></b>, which Slikey views as the most 'stable' income source, but brings all the positives and negatives of a GaaS environment.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nFor the moment, Hytale's approach is <b><u><i>Wild West</i></u></b>. Slikey notes that the team does not want to create a system that strongly associates mods with money, and while the team doesn't have a solid strategy yet, they will probably try Option 2 as their first shot while they explore ways to passively support creators w/ the creator program and find a balance that creates an 'accessible but rewarding' experience for everyone.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nImportantly, Slikey says the team is trying to prioritize both players and modders, and promises to try to innovate and stay on top of feedback.</p>",

A console release is planned for a later stage, and the team states they are still evaluating if a mobile version is feasible.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nThe blog post also addresses the <b><u>different editions of Hytale</u></b>, teasing an upcoming reveal for what each edition contains, and confirming players can choose to upgrade between each version even after purchase. The Hytale Team also confirms that there will be no bonuses for pre-purchasing Hytale, to avoid creating FOMO, and that gifting is still being worked on.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nAddressing <b><u>gameplay questions</u></b>, the blog post confirms pets, animal taming, and fishing systems are planned, but are not currently implemented into the game.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nShifting focus to Hytale's <b><u>monetization</u></b>, the team reconfirmed that Hytale will take a 0% cut from third-party server or modding transactions for <u>the first two years</u>, and confirmed a hard cap of a 20% cut after that two year period has lapsed. In a Tweet, Simon promised the Hytale Team would provide players, assets, and/or code if/when they take a % of transactions. On the subject of <b><u>Hytale's Creator Program</u></b>, the team announces that <i>anyone</i> that creates Hytale content regularly - videos, music, mods, art, streams, etc - can sign up for the program and (if their code is used) receive 5% from any sales, with plans to raise that percentage to 7%. Simon later revealed that the team is hoping to open the Creator Program before pre-orders.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nThe blog post also discussed <b><u>regional pricing</u></b>, confirming that the team is working to get it functional for a limited number of countries to start with - with the hope being to get it done in time for the pre-purchase. On Twitter, Lyall said regional pricing is his <b>main focus</b>, other than legal work.</p>",

Alleviating a user's concerns, Simon confirmed that all zones are accessible, but crafting does slow down in order to prevent skipping to late zones. Simon also stated that the goal is to keep all zones relevant throughout the whole game, in order to give players a true exploration experience.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nWhen asked about Zones 5 and 6, Simon sadly confirmed that they don't exist at the moment - though they might revisit the zones in the future, with new world gen.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nThe Hytale Team also shared a new blogpost, dedicated to <i><b><u>Hytale's Creative Mode.</u></b></i></p>",

Mewen confirmed the team is already planning for controller support (including Adaptive Controller from Microsoft), and considering features like multi-press, changing controller schema based on context, and also discussed features/designs for people who are hard of hearing, such as a visual audio cue wheel and a ping wheel. Mewen also mentioned assessing text resizing options.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nDiscussing the game's tech, Slikey revealed that Hytale plans to have a compatibility layer in the future, to give players the change to update their mods and servers. Slikey later confirmed that Hytale does currently have an error similar to Minecraft's bug that leads to the 'farlands' phenomenon. Slikey also discussed merging all of the game's branches into a single branch in a <b><i>Singularity Event</i></b>. Simon also revealed that Hytale currently has no plans for custom shaders, but the team will explore options later on.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nMoving to gameplay discussions, Simon revealed that the <i>new</i> engine's lighting system can be replicated in the legacy engine, and the plan is to do so after optimizations are finished. Simon also revealed that Hytale's combat was designed with PVP in mind, but the current goal isn't to balance it for PVP or minigames. Simon also revealed that gliders have been added to Hytale, and that rat's can still be lured by dropped cheese.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nHytale officially shared a screenshot of a <u>Zone 3 Ritual</u>.</p><p class='mainTextParagraph'></p>",

Simon confirmed that Cursebreaker edition would <b><i><u>not</u></i></b> come with extra copies of the game, and thus the price was reduced as compensation. Simon also confirmed that the Early Access release date would be announced <i>by end of next week.</i> </p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nMoving on to gameplay discussions, Simon confirmed that Hytale will not have grid crafting, and will instead have a more innovative and intuitive crafting system that allows players to upgrade work stations. When asked about building, Simon announced that work on block rotations and other cool features was finished, with connections and smart block placements being polished. Simon also mentioned that plans exist for automations and fun gadgets, but aren't being worked on at the moment. Simon also teased gliders and hookshots as future features for Hytale, also revealing the discovery of a Faun model in the game's files. Finally, Simon shared the first ever picture of Slothians in-game. </p><p class='mainTextParagraph'>\n\nLater, Slikey explains that singleplayer mode creates a local server, allowing for 'server side' mods to work on singleplayer. Alleviating concerns, Slikey confirmed that despite this, singleplayer <b>can</b> be played without an internet connection. Finally, Slikey explained that it's likely too early for Hytale to be able to support a Create-like mod, though some parts should still be possible.</p>",

        "mainText": "<p class='mainTextParagraph'>On November 17th, 2025, Reddoons published an Exclusive Interview with Simon. In the interview, Simon stated that Exploration Mode was a temporary replacement for Adventure Mode, as the vision for the mode is far from what they can offer at the moment. Exploration Mode will server as the foundation for the game, eventually having a living world and other features that build and become Adventure Mode, such as dungeons, epic boss fights, and more. Exploration Mode will let players fight, loot, farm, explore, build, and play with friends - serving as more of a prologue to what Hytale will be. In the short to medium term, Simon wants to focus on fast wins, not spending months on a single update and instead bombarding players with constant updates before eventually moving to bigger updates when the game is in a solid state. Simon teases introducing features that are typical in RPGs or even ARPGs, and says the portals system in Hytale's End Game might be simple at launch, but is a feature that (in the long term vision) allows them to truly expand their creativity. Simon says Hytale is made different by its movements, combat, vibe, and controls, with the world gen v2 and ability to mod the game being very exciting to him. Crucially, Simon says he wants Hytale to not be a survival game, but an adventure game that is easy to learn and hard to master.</p>",

In the interview, Simon stated he believes his decision to sell Hytale was still the right decision, as it secured funding for the team, and put him in position to be able to purchase Hytale and attempt to save it. While the goal is to reach the vision of Hytale presented in the trailer, things will change due to the changes in circumstances/genre over the years. Simon repeatedly states that the community should keep expectations low, realize the game will launch with many bugs and missing features, but maintain confidence that the game will eventually be great. The trailer was 'ambitious, but achievable.' Simon says he wants players to feel at home - safe, comfortable, and excited - when they play Hytale for the first time. When asked about a 'credits roll' moment, Simon says he envisions credits never rolling, with the story continuing to be updated for years - no defined end point in development. When asked about a roadmap, Simon says the first goal is launch - then create a decent gameplay loop. Success for Hytale means releasing as soon as possible, and updating one feature at a time for a long time. Simon finishes the interview by thanking the believers.</p>",
