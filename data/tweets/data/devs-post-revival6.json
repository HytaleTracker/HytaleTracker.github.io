    "mainText": "'Hytale early access date is now set for January 13, 2026.\r\n\r\nThis is true early access, meaning it’s still very much unfinished and broken, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be. The game isn't good yet; eventually, it will be. If you don’t feel comfortable pre-ordering or participating in Early Access, please don’t.\r\n\r\nHytale and Hypixel Studios are independent again, and we are returning to the original vision from the 2018 trailer. Because we went back to an older game build from 4 years ago that was now meant for prototyping, some parts of the game will feel behind, but our momentum is strong, and we’re working fast to make this into the game we all dreamed of.\r\n\r\nModding and creative tools are in a decent state; however, they’re not where we want them long term. That being said, they’re ready for players who want to create content on day 1. This is a good moment for modders, server owners, and creators to step in early! They will play a significant role in Hytale’s future.\r\n\r\nThe first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more. More details are coming soon. Follow our social channels for updates, and we hope to see you on January 13, 2026.\r\n\r\nThank you, everyone, for your support. Hytale has been through a long journey, and soon, we will be home.'\n\n(This is pretty much the blogpost)",
