The team is fantastic. I am beyond happy with how things are going; they will make Hytale the dream game we always wanted it to be. I am 100% sure of it. Please give us some time to launch, patch and work towards that dream.\r\n\r\nI suggest you don't take a day off work on launch day; we WILL have launch-day issues with the launcher, logins, downloads, and other areas that could go wrong.\r\nRest assured, once you have downloaded and logged in once, you can be offline without issue. \r\n\r\nWe received far more pre-purchases than we expected, and we are doing our best to welcome everyone as soon as possible.'",
