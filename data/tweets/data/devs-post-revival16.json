They don't scale properly and appear too far away. They need a complete rework; they don't look great, and they should be more minimalist. \r\n7- Combat might feel a bit floaty at times, but it's getting better as we progress. Controls are feeling good, though.\r\n8- Blocking mechanisms are not done yet; you can block a full signature hit with low stam with daggers. \r\n\r\nAnd the list goes on and on and on! Told you guys this is early access! \r\n\r\nHowever, we are AWARE and will fix it all over time. Give us a couple of months, and you will get some very good PvP in Hytale. We love playing the game and will keep at it for years to come!'",

We are launching the native Linux and given the diversity of the Linux ecosystem, we are treating the Linux launch as \"experimental\".\r\nWe have programmers on the team who natively work on Hytale using Linux, so expect support to expand and improve.\r\nSystem requirements should be similar to Windows - RAM requirements may be lower due to Windows usually hogging more memory as an OS.\r\nSo all in all, you will be able to download Hytale for Linux, you will be able to install it and run it but chances are there may be some issues you run into that are super specific to your distro. We rely on reports to fix those issues. \r\nWe have not tried and won't try Proton. Given that we don't do any kernel-level anticheat, you will probably be able to run it via a compatibility layer too but that's for the community to find out.\r\nOne test was conducted on a Steamdeck with attached docking station (Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse) and got well playable results in local singleplayer. (Steamdeck is NOT officially recommended as there is NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT YET).\r\n\r\n🍎Mac: \r\nWe WOULD be ready to launch for native MacOS (Apple Silicon / M Chips) - however we are missing the signing certificate. The ticket keeps being reset in the queue and we have to keep calling them. \r\nSystem requirements are work in progress - we have tried it on M3+ at the moment and we are working our way back in time to find the lowest limit. We will NOT launch Hytale for Intel Macs as Apple themselves abandon them in the next MacOS version. We are a small team and there is no way we can support abandoned platforms.\r\nSo for Mac, we use it internally to play on and even work on it but ultimately we have no way to ship it without the certificate. As soon as we have it, we will update you.\r\n\r\nWe will update the requirements on blog & store in the coming days.'",

I did my best to clean it up!\r\n\r\nNote that we didn’t use potions, food, traps, totems, blocks or magic. We’re really just testing the fundamentals and getting a feel for the core combat. We’ll add many more features and work closely with PvPers to ensure combat feels right and continues to improve over the years. We aim to bring a range of PvP minigames and support the community in creating their own PvP content. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm really excited about is seeing the community revive classic PvP modes like Bed Wars, Survival Games, Skywars, UHC, Extractions and more. \r\n\r\nNot only am I working on the game, business, and partnerships, but I'm also learning DaVinci Resolve in my free time to deliver you guys some raw footage. I'm in the trenches, bois😅'",

Honestly, the transparent answer is anger.\r\n\r\nThe game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features. That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used. \r\n\r\nWhen you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\nIt’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.\r\n\r\nIt should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.\r\n\r\nSo yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves.'",
